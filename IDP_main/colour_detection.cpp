  TODO
    how to check if robot not moving?
      -> could check if motors are currently running RELEASE
      -> could set motor speed to zero when robot stops, and check motor speed
      -> could set some kind of boolean flag eg. bool robotIsMoving, bool robotHasStopped etc.
    how to handle led cycle?
      -> could initialise with HIGH so that led cycles indefinitely
      -> then either check if led is still moving eg. every cycle of loop(), with some if() statement
      -> or, attach some kind of interrupt eg. which triggers when detect that robot stops moving and a flag is set
    maybe functions will look something like
    void setAmberLEDCycle()
    void suspendAmberLEDCycle()
